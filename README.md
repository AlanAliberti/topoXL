The *TopoXL* project is aimed to provide basic functionality for working with spatial data in a spreadsheet. This, in conjunction with basic data manipulation capabilities, expose a quick way of performing computation and analysis on data which is described by coordinates without the need of a graphical interface. The functionality is designed to be used as a user-defined function (UDF) library in *Microsoft Excel* environment. It is not designed to be a replacement for a CAD or GIS environment nor to provide the full functionality exposed by such environments. *TopoXL* deals with linear referencing and coordinate geometry problems but is limited to the capabilities of a spreadsheet. For a full description of its functionality please check the [Documentation](#Documentation) section of this document.
